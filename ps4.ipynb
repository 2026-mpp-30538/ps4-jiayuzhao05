        "   - Example: \"Brooklyn Banker Pleads Guilty to Laundering Proceeds\"\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Drug Enforcement**: Keywords include \"drug\", \"opioid\", \"fentanyl\", \"controlled substance\", \"narcotic\", etc.\n",
        "   - Example: \"Pharmacy Owner Charged with Illegal Distribution of Opioids\"\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Bribery/Corruption**: Keywords include \"bribery\", \"kickback\", \"corruption\", \"conspiracy\", etc.\n",
        "   - Example: \"Official Sentenced for Accepting Kickbacks\"\n",
        "\n",

        "   - Example: General fraud cases not fitting other categories\n",
        "\n",
        "The classification prioritizes specificity, checking for bribery/corruption and drug enforcement first (as these are often explicitly mentioned), then financial fraud, and finally health care fraud (which is the most common category)."
